***Multi-room P2P chat on Holochain**

**[Code Status:](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/milestones?direction=asc&sort=completeness&state=all)** Pre-alpha. Not for production use. This application has not been audited for any security validation.

## Install

1. Install the Holochain command line dev tool by following the instructions here: https://developer.holochain.org/start.html

2. Clone this repo:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/holochain/holochat-rust
```

3. Make sure things are working by running the tests:

```shell
cd holochat-rust/test
npm install
cd ..
hc test | test/node_modules/faucet/bin/cmd.js
```

Note that by using the " | test/node_modules/faucet/bin/cmd.js" you lose the `console.log` output of your tests, but gain nice color coding.
If you want to see the logs, just use `hc test`.

4. Compile the DNA and run it using `hc` with:

```shell
hc run --port 3400 --package
```

Finally to run the holochat UI, simply open the `ui/index.html` file in a browser, and it should start communicating with the `hc` via websockets.
